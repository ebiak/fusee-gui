# fusee-gui
A Gui interface for fusee-gelee and pretty much a bootleg version of tegrarcmgui

# Credits
* [Kate Temkin](https://twitter.com/ktemkin "Her twitter") for discovering the fusee-gelee exploit
* [falquinho](github.com/falquinho) for making fusee-gelee as a module
* [David Buchanan](gist.github.com/DavidBuchanan314 "His gist repository") for the EHCI patch code 
* [eliboa](github.com/eliboa) because I pretty much stole his design for TegraRcmGui
